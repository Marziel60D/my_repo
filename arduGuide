Test Set 1: Basic Functionality
Test Case 1.1: Counting Up
Input: Push Button 1 (Count Up)
Expected Output: LCD displays "COUNT_UP" on the first line, and the time counts up from 00.0 in 0.1-second increments.
After 1 second: LCD displays 01.0 s.
After 10 seconds: LCD displays 10.0 s.
After 20 seconds: LCD stops counting and displays 20.0 s, with the state returning to "STOP".
Test Case 1.2: Counting Down
Input: Push Button 2 (Count Down)
Expected Output: LCD displays "COUNT_DOWN" on the first line, and the time counts down from 20.0 in 0.1-second decrements.
After 1 second: LCD displays 19.0 s.
After 10 seconds: LCD displays 10.0 s.
After 20 seconds: LCD stops counting and displays 00.0 s, with the state returning to "STOP".
Test Case 1.3: Stop and Reset
Input: Push Button 1 (Count Up), wait for 5 seconds, then push Button 3 (Stop/Reset)
Expected Output: LCD shows the current state as "STOP" and freezes the count (e.g., 05.0 s).
Action: Push Button 3 (Stop/Reset) again to reset the count.
Expected Output: LCD displays 00.0 s, and the system remains in the "STOP" state.
Test Set 2: Button Debouncing and Transitions
Test Case 2.1: Multiple Button Presses
Input: Push Button 1 (Count Up) and Button 3 (Stop/Reset) immediately after, within 200 ms.
Expected Output: The system should not register both presses as one. It should only respond to the first button press (Count Up) and start counting, with "COUNT_UP" displayed.
Test Case 2.2: Transition Between Count Up and Count Down
Input: Push Button 1 (Count Up), wait for 5 seconds, then push Button 2 (Count Down).
Expected Output: The system should stop counting up and immediately switch to "COUNT_DOWN" and begin counting down from the current time (e.g., from 05.0 s to 04.9 s, etc.).
Test Set 3: Boundary Conditions
Test Case 3.1: Maximum Time Boundary
Input: Push Button 1 (Count Up) and wait until the time reaches 20.0 s.
Expected Output: The system should stop automatically once the time reaches 20.0 s and display "STOP" without exceeding 20.0 s.
Test Case 3.2: Minimum Time Boundary
Input: Push Button 2 (Count Down) and wait until the time reaches 00.0 s.
Expected Output: The system should stop automatically once the time reaches 00.0 s and display "STOP" without going below 00.0 s.
Test Set 4: Usability and Edge Case Handling
Test Case 4.1: Button Press Without Reset
Input: Push Button 1 (Count Up) and allow the timer to count up to 15.0 s. Push Button 3 (Stop/Reset) and then push Button 1 (Count Up) again.
Expected Output: The timer should start counting up from where it left off (15.0 s).
Test Case 4.2: Simultaneous Button Presses
Input: Push both Button 1 (Count Up) and Button 2 (Count Down) simultaneously.
Expected Output: The system should ignore this input and remain in its current state (either "STOP", "COUNT_UP", or "COUNT_DOWN").
Test Set 5: LCD Display Tests
Test Case 5.1: Leading Zero Display
Input: Push Button 1 (Count Up) and allow the time to count up to 09.9 s.
Expected Output: LCD should display leading zeros, ensuring the format is 09.9 s instead of 9.9 s.
Test Case 5.2: Correct Decimal Point Precision
Input: Push Button 1 (Count Up) or Button 2 (Count Down) and observe the time.
Expected Output: The time should display with one decimal precision (e.g., 10.5 s instead of 10.50 s).
Summary:
This test specification focuses on validating the expected behavior under various input conditions, boundary cases, and usability edge cases. Each test case ensures that the system behaves as expected under normal, debounced, and simultaneous button press scenarios, while the time display format remains accurate on the LCD.
