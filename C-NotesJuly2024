Sharing a poem bout myself, I created back then thats still true today,
I am (Mark Daniel C., 2016)
Sometimes people saw me as a clown,
Sometimes people saw me double edge knife,
A snake saw me as a joke, uncapable,
A crab saw me as the ground, never been equal,
A fox saw me as a monkey,
The turtle saw me as a seed, grows into anything,
But close people saw me as a flame, a scorching one, destroying everything once in rage,
A friend saw me as a cat, clingy but can't be pet,
A best friend saw me either an angel or a demon, comfort, sensitive and honest.
A family saw me as sheep, to guide or a sacrifice.
Siblings saw me as a little spider, a mastermind,
Mom saw me as a little kitty on the street, 
Home saw me as flower, a delicate one, needs protection and care.
Rare people saw me as a shade, someone they can rest on.
Love?? I think...never saw me..
Me, myself, and I saw me as a water, either a blessing or the disaster,
Or a bastard f*cker  who compares people with animals .
