Sharing a poem bout myself, I created back then thats still true today,
I am (Mark Daniel C., 2016)
Sometimes people saw me as a clown,
Sometimes people saw me double edge knife,
A snake saw me as a joke, uncapable,
A crab saw me as the ground, never been equal,
A fox saw me as a monkey,
The turtle saw me as a seed, grows into anything,
But close people saw me as a flame, a scorching one, destroying everything once in rage,
A friend saw me as a cat, clingy but can't be pet,
A best friend saw me either an angel or a demon, comfort, sensitive and honest.
A family saw me as sheep, to guide or a sacrifice.
Siblings saw me as a little spider, a mastermind,
Mom saw me as a little kitty on the street, 
Home saw me as flower, a delicate one, needs protection and care.
Rare people saw me as a shade, someone they can rest on.
Love?? I think...never saw me..
Me, myself, and I saw me as a water, either a blessing or the disaster,
Or a bastard f*cker  who compares people with animals .

I have excel files for each of my team member, let say we're 5 member, Gehlee, Eli, Seowon, yoona and ME, in this member file cell colomn A contains planned time and in colomn B contains Actual time consumed for each task, in cell D it contains productivity percetage which is equal to planned time/ Actual time, and in coloum E the month when the task is performed

Now I have this overall file which show each members productivity each month, on cell A the name of the members, and on colomn B and the proceding colomn contains the monthy productivity of the member and to compute monthly productivity of each member its equal to the sum of planned time/sum of actual time that month.
Now can create me this files while linking members file to overall files, you can add VBA for excel if you can but it wont be necessary if the excel performs well



It sounds like your issue is related to embedded programming, possibly on a microcontroller or a bare-metal system where memory sections are manually managed. Here's what could be happening:

1. Loop Termination Depends on a Struct: If a for loop is not exiting, it's likely because the condition check is failing. If this condition is based on a struct that isn't being updated correctly due to memory mapping issues, the loop may never reach its "true" exit case.


2. Missing Memory Section in SS_STACK: The .data, .s_data, and .ss_stack sections usually hold initialized variables, small data, and stack space. If these are not correctly mapped in the linker script or memory configuration (e.g., in SS_STACK in the ROM folder), the program may be accessing incorrect values or uninitialized memory.


3. Differences Between Main and MCDC: If both main and MCDC (possibly a test coverage module) reference memory sections inconsistently, it could lead to undefined behavior, causing the loop to misbehave. Ensuring that both reference the same memory sections explicitly would prevent discrepancies.


4. Possible Causes:

The struct used as a loop limiter is not properly initialized or loaded into memory.

Variables in .data or .s_data are being accessed incorrectly due to incorrect memory mappings.

The stack (.ss_stack) might not be properly set up, causing unintended behavior in function calls.




Solution:

Adding explicit addresses for .data, .ss_stack, and .s_data in the SS_STACK file ensures that the linker correctly places these sections in memory. This prevents uninitialized or corrupted memory from affecting program flow, which might be why the loop wasn't evaluating the condition properly before.

Let me know if you need more details based on your specific setup!
